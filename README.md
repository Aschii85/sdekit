# Welcome the SDEkit, the Stochastic Differential Equation library!

Create arbitrary Continuous Time Markov- and Ito Processes, to be simulated using [Euler-Maruyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method) and [2nd Order Runge-Kutta](https://doi.org/10.1137/09076636X) schemes.

See `main.py` for an example on how to use the package. 


### Todo

- Add support for quasi-Monte Carlo samplers in the Incrementors
